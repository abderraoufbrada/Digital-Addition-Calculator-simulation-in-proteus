## Project Overview
This project is a **2-bit Digital Addition Calculator Simulation** built in **Proteus**.  

The calculator allows users to input numbers **1, 2, or 3** and performs addition using digital logic. The system uses:  
- An **encoder** to encode the input values.  
- A **2-bit adder** to compute the sum.  
- A **7-segment decoder** to display the result using LEDs.  

This simulation demonstrates basic digital logic design and how encoders, adders, and decoders work together.

## Features
- Accepts inputs 1, 2, or 3.  
- Performs addition using a 2-bit adder.  
- Displays results on a 7-segment LED display.  
- Fully simulated in Proteus for demonstration purposes.

## How It Works
1. User selects a number (1–3) for input.  
2. The **encoder** converts the input into binary form.  
3. The **2-bit adder** computes the sum of the binary inputs.  
4. The **7-segment decoder** converts the binary sum into a format that can light up the LEDs.  
5. The LEDs display the final result on the simulated 7-segment display.

## How to Run
1. Open **Proteus**.  
2. Load `https://github.com/abderraoufbrada/Digital-Addition-Calculator-simulation-in-proteus/blob/main/Digital%20Addition%20Calculator.pdsprj`.  
3. Run the simulation.  
4. Select the input numbers (1–3) and observe the result on the LED 7-segment display.
